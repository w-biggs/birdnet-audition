# BirdNET for Adobe Audition

Identify birds in a recording with just a click of a button!

Currently only installable by cloning this folder to your extensions folder and enabling unsigned extensions.

## TODO

- Use local BirdNET exclusively
- Make the local command configurable
- Need to click twice
